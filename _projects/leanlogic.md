title: "Entailment and Contradiction Detection (ECD) and Natural Language Inference (NLI)"
year: 2012
venue: "I worked for many years at  Xerox's PARC on the  Bridge project. Together with Katerina Kalouli and Dick Crouch we produced a new Bridge-like system, with free and open tools. This work can be seen at http://h2942521.stratoserver.net:8080/katerina.kalouli/resources.html.
Some of this work has to do with lexical resources and connects to the work below. Some of it has to do with work with Gerard de Melo on an implicative lexicon. Some of it is more theorem proving and connects to work with Vivek Nigam. Some of it is really logic and it may connect to  Linear Logic"
