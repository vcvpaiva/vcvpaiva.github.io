title: "Lean Logic and Entailment and Contradiction Detection (ECD)"
year: 2012
venue: "I worked for many years at  Xerox's PARC on the  Bridge project and I am engaged in the process of producing a new version of Bridge, with different and free tools. Some of this work has to do with lexical resources and connects to work below. Some of it has to do with work with Gerard de Melo on a implicative lexicon. Some of it is more theorem proving and connects to work with Vivek Nigam. Some of it is really logic and it may connect to  Linear Logic"
