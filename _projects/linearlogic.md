title: "Categorical Structures for  (Linear) Logic"
year: 1990
venue: "For my thesis I worked on categorical models of Linear  Logic, then a promising new logic touted for its applications to computing. My thesis uncovered a connection between linear logic and Goedel's Dialectica interpretation boosting linear logic's reputation and, at the same time, reminding logicians of Godel's ingenious way of proving relative consistency of arithmetic. Since then I have described many variants of Linear Logic: FILL(Hyland, Eades), DILL(Barber and Plotkin), ILT(Maietti and Ritter), etc. I have also  applied new calculi (linear or not), e.g. FIL(Pereira), CS4(Alechina, Mendler), CK(Bellin, Ritter), IHL(Brauner), to modelling phenomena in Computing and Mathematics"
