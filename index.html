<h4>Welcome!</h4> 

I am a mathematician and AI research scientist with a passion for natural language processing, logical inference, and the many forms of semantics. 
I work at the <a href="https://topos.institute">Topos Institute</a> in Berkeley—an inspiring place to explore the deep connections between mathematics, 
logic, and computation. 
I earned my PhD under the supervision of Martin Hyland, working on Dialectica categories, and my thesis is available 
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-213.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.   

On this site you’ll find my research interests, my <a href="includes/valeriaCV2023.pdf">curriculum vitae </a> and 
<a href="includes/dePaiva-resume.pdf">résumé</a>, as well as links to my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeria_de_Paiva">Wikipedia page</a> 
and my blog <a ref="https://logic-forall.blogspot.com/"> Logic ForAll</a>. You can also watch some of my recent 
<a href="https://vcvpaiva.github.io/RecordedTalks"> Recorded Talks</a>. 
From 2020–2023 I served as a council member of the <a ref="http://dlmps.org/pages/council/council-2020-2023.php">Division of Logic, 
Methodology, and Philosophy of Science and Technology</a>, which invited me to record a short <a ref="http://dlmps.org/">video</a> on logic—earning me the unofficial 
title of <a href="https://logicday.vcla.at/">“Ambassador of Logic.”</a>    

I am deeply committed to supporting women in logic and computer science. I co-founded and help maintain the 
<a href="http://www.womeninlogic.org">Women in Logic</a> website, <a href="http://womeninlogic.blogspot.com/">Women in Logic blog</a>, and 
Facebook group, as well as a curated collection of <a href="https://womeninlogic.github.io/RecordedTalks//">Women in Logic talks</a>. 
I serve on the steering committee for Women in Logic and help organize the Workshop on Women in Logic, which just had its 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/wil2025/home/"> ninth edition</a> in 
Birmingham, UK. I also contribute to the ACM-W Scholarship Program, which supports women students in computing worldwide.

<h4>Research Interests</h4>

My research spans category theory, programming languages, type theories, and logic in computer science, as well as the semantics of 
natural language and logic for lexical semantics. I work on search methods and evaluation, knowledge graphs, and ontologies, 
and I have a special interest in linear and modal logics and their applications to mathematics. Recently, I’ve focused on NLP methods 
for mathematical text, building tools to extract, structure, and reason about mathematical knowledge.
