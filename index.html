<h4>Welcome!</h4>

I am a Mathematician and AI Research Scientist, interested in NLP, logical  Inference and all kinds of semantics. I work at the <a href="https://topos.institute">Topos Institute</a>, Berkeley, a very exciting place.
Once upon a time I finished my Ph.D. under the direction
of <a href="https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~martin/">Martin Hyland</a>,
and my thesis can be found <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-213.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
On this page you can  find my research interests, my contact information, a <a href="includes/valeriaCV2023.pdf"> curriculum vitae </a> and <a href="includes/dePaiva-resume.pdf">resume</a> for me. Also the link to my Wikipedia  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeria_de_Paiva">page</a> and my blog <a ref="https://logic-forall.blogspot.com/"> Logic ForAll</a>. <br><br>

You also can see some of the recorded  <a href="https://vcvpaiva.github.io/RecordedTalks">talks I have  given</a> recently. <br><br>

I am very keen on making sure that women are not short-changed in their professional lives. For that I help  maintain the <a href="http://www.womeninlogic.org">Women in Logic</a>  website, a facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/WomenInLogic/">Women in Logic</a>, a blog  <a href="http://womeninlogic.blogspot.com/">Women in Logic</a> and now a website of curated <a href="https://womeninlogic.github.io/RecordedTalks//">Women in Logic talks</a>. I am  in the <a href="https://www.womeninlogic.org/governance">Steering Committtee<a> of Women in Logic. I also  help with the ACM-W Scholarship program <a href="https://women.acm.org/scholarships/">ACM-W Scholarship program</a>. Most importantly I initiated and help to organize the Workshop Women in Logic, now in its <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/wil2023/">seventh edition</a>.

<h4>Research Interests</h4>

My research interests span several areas. To begin with  category theory, programming languages, type theories, and logic in computer science, in general. Then semantics of Natural Language, logic for semantics and lexical semantics. Then search methods and measurements, knowledge graphs and commonsense ontologies. 
More fun comes in the shape of linear and modal logic, and applications to mathematics.
